My blog featuring a fairly customized version of https://github.com/foo-dogsquared/hugo-theme-more-contentful/[my More Contentful Hugo theme].




== Getting started

Though, it's obvious but then again, you may not remember how to do well in a year.


=== Prerequisites

* Git
* Hugo
* https://golang.org/[Go] runtime
* https://asciidoctor.org/[Asciidoctor]
* https://git.sr.ht/~sircmpwn/openring/[openring] (you can easily compile one yourself with the Go toolchain)


=== Setting up

[source, shell]
----
git clone $GIT_REPO
hugo mod get -u
hugo serve
----

The theme is a modified version of a https://github.com/foo-dogsquared/hugo-theme-more-contentful[modified version of a theme] so that's pretty cool.

To create a post, simply make with `hugo new --kind post $PATH_REL_TO_CONTENT_DIR` and you're on your merry way.
