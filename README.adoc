My blog.




== Getting started

Though, it's obvious but hey.


=== Prerequisites

* Git
* Hugo
* https://golang.org/[Go] runtime
* https://asciidoctor.org/[Asciidoctor]


=== Setting up

[source, shell]
----
git clone $GIT_REPO
hugo mod get -u
hugo serve
----

The theme is a modified version of a https://github.com/foo-dogsquared/hugo-theme-more-contentful[modified version of a theme] so that's pretty cool.

To create a post, simply make with `hugo new --kind post $PATH_REL_TO_CONTENT_DIR` and you're on your merry way.
