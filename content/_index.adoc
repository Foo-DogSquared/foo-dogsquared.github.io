Hey there!
I'm Gabriel Arazas (`foo-dogsquared`), a hobbyist on software development and programming, an expert in procastination, and a hack on anything else.
You can see more what's my deal on xref:about.adoc[another page] because I want to make introductions nice and brief.

Welcome to my small home on the deepest corners of the internet, by the way.
Have a seat and take a look in my digital cavern.

.Here's my first productive digital art painting.
