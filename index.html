    Hello there, visitor! Who am I you ask? I'm just a student learning a bunch of tech-related stuff. 
    Hopefully you'll find some of my posts useful (HINT: the (Re)Sources section and my resource lists). 
</p>

    Oh, I should also remind you like in any other parts of the internet, take my posts with a grain of 
    salt.
