This is a free resource list that gradually grew over the past few months. Admittedly, I don't
use all of them so why not just share it, right?

Just pick a few, don't be overwhelmed by the number of resource you have to refer to.
Focus on one thing at a time.  Well, the list is actually longer but I decided to pick the 
top contenders of the list (and some of them are still not being used, I just like to
bookmark stuff and never checking out again sometimes).

Do keep in mind, most of them are related to computer programming but some of the providers offer
stuff outside of programming (say [Khan Academy](https://khanacademy.org) for math).
