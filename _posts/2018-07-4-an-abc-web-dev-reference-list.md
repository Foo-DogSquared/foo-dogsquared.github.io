Another resource list? What is the difference of this and [that one]({% post_url 2018-05-1-free-resource-list %})?

This resource list, as you might have read from the title, is aimed towards beginners who wants to begin some web design, 
web development, or programming, in general. This curated list contains tutorials and stuff that makes a beginner follow 
the reference smoothly.

As said in the previous resource list, don't be overwhelmed, at least by a whole lot. Yes, you still feel overwhelmed and 
that's inevitable but hopefully, not because of the number of the resources listed here. You don't need to pick all of them, just 
pick a few. The resources in the same category says the same pretty much, anyway. 游때

## Absolute beginner? Start here!
### Don't know why you want to do this?
- [This roadmap might be able to help you decide](https://github.com/kamranahmedse/developer-roadmap)

The first thing that you'll learn about is HTML and CSS. They are often bundled together since you can about HTML in a day (seriously).
You will not be a master in a day but it's enough to move on to CSS. Majority of the links included below often features them together for that reason. 

But still even if you don't have any decision on that and have to do it for other reasons (such as school grades, work requirements, and just for the gist for it). You can still continue 
down in this list that is categorized according to how they present their information.

## Pick Your Tools!
Basically this image:
<center><img src="{{ '../assets/pictures/web-dev-tools-expanding-brain.png' | relative_url }}">
<p class="caption">This is what you are here for, yeah?</p></center>

But seriously speaking, here are some of the tools that can help you in your budding growth as a web developer. Just take note 
that these tools do not entirely define your path as a developer so don't rely on it a bit too much. That said do note to get 
comfortable using them to level up further your productivity, it'll take a while but it'll be worth it 游때:
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) --- really recommended; stable performance, cross-platform (can be found on Windows, Mac, and Linux), powerful features, and customizable
- [Atom](https://atom.io/) --- another text editor rivalling VS Code, being free and customizable
- [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/) --- another free code editor with syntax highlighting and plugins

Some of you might ask for a plugin list but try to learn without the plugins first. Oh fine, here's some of them:
- [This list of stuff for Visual Studio Code](https://github.com/viatsko/awesome-vscode)
- [This list of stuff for Atom](https://github.com/mehcode/awesome-atom)
- [This plugins hub for Notepad++](http://docs.notepad-plus-plus.org/index.php?title=Plugin_Central)

## Want to level up a bit?
Then try to **learn JavaScript**, even if you are decided to go on design instead of say building and creating algorithms, you are still going to 
encounter JavaScript code and program things with JavaScript. It is considered as one of the front-end development toolkit, after all. Plus, selling 
yourself in the real industry only knowing HTML and CSS is like suicide so don't do it...

Anyways, don't know where to start? Here are some of them based on your learning preferences, of course I recommend to check them all out:

### Text-based References

Then you can try some more interactive form of learning, some of those examples are:

## Final words
This is all of the resources I can recommend for now. I'm sure it will be expanded at some point. And if you think the contents of 
this post if this is too much or too little for the newcomers, feel free to contact me from one of the sites listed at the footer 
to voice out what do you think is something wrong here.

I don't know if this will help fellow new developers but at least I tried. 游땪

Oh well, if you're reading this, then good luck to your journey of whatever you want to be. 游때
